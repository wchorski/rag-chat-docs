Poodles come in various sizes—standard, miniature, and toy—with curly coats in colors such as white, black, apricot, and gray. Their ears are long and hang close to the head, enhancing their dignified appearance. Standard Poodles typically stand around 22–27 inches and weigh 45–70 pounds.  

This breed is known for being exceptionally intelligent, alert, and eager to learn. Poodles are active and enjoy swimming, agility, and obedience training.  

Originally bred in Germany as water retrievers, Poodles later became popular in France. Their intelligence and adaptability have made them one of the most trainable breeds in the world.
