---
The Shiba Inu has a plush double coat that comes in red, sesame, black and tan, or cream. Their small, triangular ears are pointy and erect. They average about 13.5–16.5 inches in height and weigh 17–23 pounds.  

Shibas are alert, confident, and independent dogs with a fox-like appearance. They can be aloof with strangers but affectionate with their families.  

Originating from Japan, the Shiba Inu was bred for hunting small game in mountainous regions. Their intelligence and spirited personality make them both challenging and rewarding companions.
