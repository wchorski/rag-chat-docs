title: "Bulldog"
---
Bulldogs have a smooth, short coat that comes in brindle, white, fawn, or piebald colors. Their ears are small and folded, giving them a distinctive look that matches their wrinkled faces. They stand about 14–15 inches tall and weigh 40–50 pounds.  

Known for their calm and courageous temperament, Bulldogs are affectionate and loyal to their families. Despite their tough appearance, they are gentle and great with children.  

The breed originated in England and was initially used for bull-baiting. Over time, selective breeding transformed them into the friendly and dependable companions we know today.
