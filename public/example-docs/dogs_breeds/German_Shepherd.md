title: "German Shepherd"
---
German Shepherds have a dense double coat that comes in colors such as black and tan, sable, or solid black. Their erect, pointy ears give them an alert and noble look. Males typically reach 24–26 inches in height and weigh around 65–90 pounds.  

This breed is loyal, courageous, and confident, often forming strong bonds with their owners. They are protective yet gentle when properly socialized, making them both excellent family companions and working dogs.  

Known for their intelligence and versatility, German Shepherds are among the top breeds in police, military, and service roles. They originated in Germany in the late 19th century, bred for herding and guarding livestock.
