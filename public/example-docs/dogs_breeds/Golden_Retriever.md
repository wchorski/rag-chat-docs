title: "Golden Retriever"

The Golden Retriever is known for its luxurious golden fur that ranges from light cream to deep gold. Their ears are floppy and set high on the head, giving them a friendly, expressive appearance. Adult males stand about 23–24 inches tall and weigh between 65–75 pounds, while females are slightly smaller.  

Golden Retrievers are famously gentle, patient, and eager to please. They are excellent family dogs and get along wonderfully with children and other pets. Their friendly disposition makes them poor guard dogs but exceptional therapy and assistance animals.  

Highly intelligent and trainable, Golden Retrievers excel in obedience, search and rescue, and service work. The breed originated in Scotland in the mid-19th century, bred for retrieving game from both water and land during hunting expeditions.
