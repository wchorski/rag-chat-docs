title: "Dachshund"
---
Dachshunds have smooth, long, or wire-haired coats in colors like red, black and tan, or chocolate. Their long, floppy ears complement their elongated bodies. They stand about 8–9 inches tall and weigh 16–32 pounds for standard sizes.  

They are brave, clever, and a little stubborn, often unaware of their small size. Dachshunds form strong bonds with their families and can be playful and protective.  

Developed in Germany, the breed was originally used for hunting badgers and other burrowing animals. Their intelligence and courage remain their defining traits.
