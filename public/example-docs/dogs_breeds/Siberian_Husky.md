title: "Siberian Husky"
---
The Siberian Husky sports a thick double coat that can be white, gray, red, or black, often with striking facial masks and bright blue or multicolored eyes. Their ears are medium-sized and pointy, standing erect. They stand about 20–24 inches tall and weigh 35–60 pounds.  

Energetic, friendly, and independent, Huskies are pack-oriented dogs that love human and canine company. They can be mischievous and require regular exercise and mental stimulation.  

Originating from Siberia, the breed was developed by the Chukchi people for pulling sleds across long distances. Their intelligence and endurance make them excellent working dogs even today.
