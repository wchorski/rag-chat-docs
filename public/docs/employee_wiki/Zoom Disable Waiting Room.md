## Multi Host
A host must start the meeting to allow others to connect. Prior to the meeting, you can set others as `Alternative Hosts`. As long as there is a host (or co-host) in the meeting, the meeting will persist even after you leave. 

You can also promote participants to host during the meeting by going through the participants list.
