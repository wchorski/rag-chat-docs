## Working with Multiple Calendars
If you are unfamiliar working with multiple calendars, Viewing 2,3,4 or more calendars can get messy.

> [!note] Your Unique Work Calendar
> Every employee gets a default work calendar. In my case it's called `Calendar - wchorski@moeits.com`.  This calendar is unique to you and is best used for appointments that only involve you and the per basis people you invite

Checking the boxes on the lefthand side populates the calendars into the right hand pane into their own column.

> [!tip] View
> As you add more calendars the view may change from *month* view to *Day Week* or *Schedule* view. I prefer *Month View* (shown in these screenshots). So you may need to switch back to Month View (Just below the **top right** corner)

### combined the calendar columns
Use the `←` button inline with the calendar name to collapse  the calendars into one view. This button is highlighted in yellow above.
### Color Code
Now that you have multiple calendars under one view, you may want to tweak the colors so they fit your color code preferences. Right click over the calendar to bring up the context menu `Color`

## Creating Events 
Creating new appointment, events, meetings while dealing with multiple calendars is not always straight forward. Here is an example of creating a new calendar entry specifically for the **Lakemoor Banquet Hall Events** group calendar
### 1. Select the calendar
First click the colored tab to the desired calendar. The selected calendar will show solid black text while the others have a muted grey color. If you can't see the difference I don't blame you, it's very subtle.

### 2. Start Creating
We will be creating a new event on *Monday 8/19/2024*. You can either
1. click into the square calendar (circled yellow)
2. click "New Appointment" (highlighted yellow)

### 3. Event Details
Double click into the event label to edit the details. There are ==3 important ==details to adding an event

1. Title (describes the unique event in 9 or less words)
2. Start & End Times (can be set as "All Day" if TBD)
3. Details (longer description of event, staff, Wifi, special client notes, etc)

### 4. Staff (Optional)
Add required staff members to delegate who will be working the event. Hit the "Attendees" button and fill out the **Required** line with coworker emails

### 5. Review 
Here we are double checking our event made on the **Lakemoor Banquet Hall Events** hall. I even added a long description for the following "Office Olympics" event.

> [!note] Location
> Here you'll see I added **Countryside Banquet Hall** in the *Location* field. But aren't we adding this to the **Lakemoor Banquet Hall Events** calendar? You're right, that was a mistake, my bad... usually you will leave this blank as the calendar name already assumes the location of the event, but you could use this field to describe if the event is different (i.e. the parking lot, interior office party, etc.)

### 6. Save
You can now hit the <button>Send</button> or <button>Save</button> to finish out. Confirm that the event is set by viewing
