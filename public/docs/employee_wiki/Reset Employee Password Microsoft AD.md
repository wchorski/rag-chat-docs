## Reset Password
Right click the username and hit `Reset Password...` 

> [!tip] password strength
> Even though this is a temporary password, please use a strong password as the account still will be accessible to many apps during the transition period. 
> 
> something like `Ch!ckenW!ng$` or `WillIsTheB3st!!!` should work in the meantime, before the user logins and is prompted to create their own password.
