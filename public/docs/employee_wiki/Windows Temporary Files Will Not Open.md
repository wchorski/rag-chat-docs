Files prepended with `~$` are lock files created temporarily when editing a file. The real file you're looking for should just be named `The real spreedsheet.xlsx`. Here are some things to try.

1. Open Excel and look for any 'recent files open'. You may find the true file in this list. 
2. Look in the same folder as the `~$` for the parent file. 
3. Check trash bin. This file could have been deleted on accident, leaving only the `~$`. 

Is this data grabbed from the website? If so we can re-download a new `.csv` from the site. If none of these tips helped, let's set a time to dig through your files and find the right one.
