title: "Australian Shepherd"
---
The Australian Shepherd has a medium-length coat that can be blue merle, red merle, black, or red, often with white and copper markings. Their ears are semi-erect and slightly rounded at the tips. They typically stand 18–23 inches tall and weigh 40–65 pounds.  

Aussies are energetic, loyal, and highly intelligent, thriving when given jobs to do. They are excellent herding dogs and excel in agility, obedience, and other canine sports.  

Despite their name, Australian Shepherds were developed in the United States, inspired by working dogs brought from Australia. Their intelligence and work ethic have made them a favorite among ranchers and active families.
