Final Fantasy VII was going to be a tough game for Squaresoft to follow up. There were very high expectations considering the fact that this was a generation defining release. I absolutely couldn’t wait for Final Fantasy VIII. Early screenshots and videos (we had just gotten the internet when the game was revealed) had me absolutely hyped. I dug the style, and trusted that Squaresoft would deliver because why not? Up to this point I had not played a bad Final Fantasy. The wait was endless. I was stoked when I finally popped the disc into my console, and I wasn’t disappointed. At first. I shelved the game for years after completing it and only recently took a second look at it. Read on to find my modern take on this storied release.

## Difficulty
Let me start out by saying that I was in denial about Final Fantasy VIII. I was determined to enjoy it. I tried so hard to get as much as possible out of this four disc adventure. As time went on my I had a more difficult time remembering the good times. My brother played through it multiple times, and as I watched I couldn’t help but feel a little sick over it. I know, that’s an extreme reaction to a video game, but that’s honestly the best way to describe it. As time went on I became more and more sure that Final Fantasy VIII wasn’t actually any good. I went in with an open mind, and honestly I did enjoy some parts of it. For the most part I was disappointed to find that my memories weren’t clouded. Final Fantasy VIII is not very good to be honest.

## Story and Setting
This installment (like all other mainline Final Fantasy titles) is a self enclosed story. The world is one of technology sprinkled with fantasy elements. You play as a young mercenary who lives and works within a construct called Garden. He is what is known as SeeD (fighters for hire) that have the ability to use guardian forces (think summons from prior games) which allow them to use magic and other abilities. The story begins as our hero, Squall, undertakes the test to become an official SeeD. He makes friends along the way who join his cause as the world comes under crisis with only he and his merry band here to save the day. The plot has your typical focus on romance (this was a heavy advertising point of it) and features many twists and turns.
