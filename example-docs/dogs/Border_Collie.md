Border Collies have a medium-length double coat that can be black and white, red and white, or tricolor. Their ears can be semi-erect or fully upright. They stand 18–22 inches tall and weigh between 30–45 pounds.  

Highly energetic and focused, Border Collies are renowned for their herding instincts and quick reflexes. They require significant physical and mental activity to remain happy and well-behaved.  

Bred along the border between Scotland and England, they were developed for herding sheep. Considered one of the most intelligent dog breeds, Border Collies excel in obedience, agility, and competitive sports.
