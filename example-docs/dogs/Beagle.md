title: "Beagle"
---
Beagles have a short, dense coat that typically features tri-color combinations of white, black, and brown. Their floppy ears are long and soft, adding to their charming, gentle expression. They stand about 13–15 inches tall and weigh 20–30 pounds.  

Beagles are curious, merry, and affectionate dogs with a strong sense of smell. They are social and friendly but can be stubborn due to their independent streak.  

Originating in England, Beagles were bred as scent hounds for hunting small game like rabbits. Their intelligence and cheerful nature make them great family pets and working companions.
